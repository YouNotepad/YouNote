1. 	All team members’ names and Stony Brook email addresses
2. 	Your tentative target user population
 CS Students who study programming through Youtube (About 200 thousand)


3. 	Problem your product will be solving
a. 	How your solution will be unique or different than existing solutions
Problem: Many Computer Science majoring students learn programming language and techniques through the youtube platform. However, to take a note, the student may use extra notes on his or her desk or may use another note-taking application while they are watching the lecture through youtube. If the student has to switch his or her screen very often to take a note, it may interfere with concentration.
Solution: add note and video in one screen, so the student does not have to switch their screen to take note. Users can adjust the video size for a comfortable note-taking environment. They can watch and write a note at once in the same window.
4. 	Two or three existing or related solutions that your target users may use already to try and solve this problem
Rocket Notes 
Google Extension Application. 
Not too friendly for taking notes.
If you switch to the screen-mode on Youtube, the note disappears to the bottom.
The system looks like a prototype and it requires the payment after 30 days use.

		Youtube Notes 
Chrome Browser Extension for Writing and managing notes for YouTube videos.
Create fixed size notepad from the chrome extension bar
The size of the notepad cannot be changed.
There are no features to make font changeable.
Only be able to see notes in the application. We cannot export this note to any other format of the file.

	Gnotes 
 A web app and chrome extension to take notes on YouTube videos. It helps people create documents better suited for consuming information on the go. 
People should paste a YouTube link to see a video (but an error occurs). 
Users cannot write a document and watch a video at once. Users need to scroll down to write a document. 

5. 	Your plan to find people in your target population to observe, survey, or interview them
a. 	Describe the process you think you will use to find these people, as you will need to interview at least 3 target users for the next assignment.
Survey computer science students in SUNY Korea and ask how many of them are using youtube as a learning platform.
Ask have they ever faced difficulties while learning through Youtube. (Screen being too small if you put on other programs to take notes or to code.)
